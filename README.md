# Getting-Started-with-Deep-Learning

### These are some of the source code that i recieved from all the lab in NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute's Getting Started with Deep Learning Course
#### Some of the datasets are missing because i cant download the datasets due to it being too large and my laptop didnt have the space for it
#### But Fortunetly some of the datasets are built in the tensorflow framework so some of the lab will still be working.
